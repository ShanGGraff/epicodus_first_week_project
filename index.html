      According to wikipedia, Manx cats (earlier spelled Manks) are a bread of cat that originally came from the Isle of
      Man. They have a mutation that causes them to have short tails or no tails at all. They are prized for there
      social personalities and were used as ship cats due to their hunting prowess. A Manx that has no tail at all, with
      only a tuff of hair, is known as a rumpy or dimple rumpy. If the Manx has a bump of cartilage, they are know as a
      riser or rumpy riser.
