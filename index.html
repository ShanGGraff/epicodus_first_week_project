    According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_cat">Wikipedia page on Manx Cats</a>, Manx cats
    (earlier spelled Manks) are a bread of cat that originally came from the Isle of Man. They have a mutation that
    causes them to have short tails or no tails at all. They are prized for there
    social personalities and were used as ship cats due to their hunting prowess. A Manx that has no tail at all, with
    only a tuff of hair, is known as a <em>rumpy</em> or <em>dimple rumpy</em>. If the Manx has a bump of cartilage,
    they are know as a <em>riser</em> or <em>rumpy riser</em>.
